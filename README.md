# piro360vjs
a simple vanillaJS piro360 frontend

to run the front end with a very simple web server,

at a shell, `run-piro.sh`

the shell script launches a very simple local python webserver to serve up the pages of
the UI.
`python3 -m http.server 9000`

Go to `http://localhost:9000` (which should load `index.html`)
